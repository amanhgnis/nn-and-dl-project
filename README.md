## Image Recoloring with Conditional GANs

- [X] Choose a dataset and write the Dataset class to transform the images to grayscale.
- [X] Implement the U-Net autoencoder.
- [X] Implement the patch GAN.
- [ ] Setup the losses and train the system.
- [ ] Improve the model with some of the suggestions or propose something yourself.
