- [X] Choose a dataset and write the Dataset class to transform the images to grayscale.
- [X] Implement the U-Net autoencoder.
- [X] Implement the patch GAN.
- [X] Setup the losses and train the system.
- [X] Improve the model with some of the suggestions or propose something yourself.
    - [X] Use additional perceptual losses.
    - [X] Implement the W-GAN training mechanism.
    - [X] One sided label smoothing.
    - [X] Pre-trained generator.
